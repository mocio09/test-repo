Strategy:

- In jenkins you always have the latest version of the build pipeline for 'main'
- When a push is made on 'main' branch or a PR is created/updated trigger a workflow that queries the jenkins server
  for the last 'main' build.
- Iterate over all pull requests open in github repo and add a pass/fail check or add a comment by a bot to approve or require changes
